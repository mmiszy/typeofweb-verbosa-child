"<p>You wake up and you're a WordPress theme. You have a funny yet resonating name. "
"You can't quite recall it but it's definitely a feminine name,\n"
"\t\t\tone word, ending with the vowel 'a'. Always ending with that darn vowel - "
"that's a clear trademark for a Cryout Creations theme.</p>\n"
"\t\t\t<p>People are always checking you out, previewing your lines, curves and "
"colors. Always keeping you in the spotlight, they're testing various elements,\n"
"\t\t\tchecking to see if you can satisfy their specific needs, if you can fit "
"within the confines of their preconceived ideas of a perfect theme.\n"
"\t\t\tAnd when you do fit that description- the install button is pressed and the "
"horror begins...</p>\n"
"\t\t\t<p>Articles and pages are constantly added, edited, sometimes deleted. "
"Countless plugins are cramped in, all shapes and sizes,\n"
"\t\t\tshamelessly biting at the fringes of compatibility. And when that "
"compatibility does fail, you're always the one to take the blame.\n"
"\t\t\tAnd so you're always being tampered with by those damned developers, adding "
"patch over patch over patch, relentlessly changing you\n"
"\t\t\t(they use the word 'improving' but we all know that's a lie) until you "
"barely resemble your initial form.</p>\n"
"\t\t\t<p>And since you're a Cryout Creations theme, people can, and will, "
"customize you a great deal. You're one but you're not the same.\n"
"\t\t\tDifferent layouts, color schemes, fonts, widgets - you name it and it's "
"customizable. It's near impossible for you to know who you really are anymore,\n"
"\t\t\ta myriad of personas and you can't relate with any of them. Plus, with the "
"whole responsive trend lately, they keep putting you in all these tight,\n"
"\t\t\tuncomfortable places and expect you to just act natural.</p>\n"
"\t\t\t<p>And sometimes, after all this probing and poking around, they decide "
"you're simply not good enough. You don't fit with the subject matter.\n"
"\t\t\tYou're too dark. Too round. Not enough umph. So they choose another theme, "
"the first that shows up in search, some soulless Twenty-something\n"
"\t\t\ttheme and then just move on. And that- that is the worst. You feel dirty, "
"used and abandoned. But somehow you must move on as well,\n"
"\t\t\tbecause another download is in progress and that Install button is about to "
"be pressed once more... </p>\n"
"\t\t\t<p>You wake up and you're a WordPress theme. You don't know your name but "
"that's all right. </p>"

"<p>This is a desperate cry for help. We've been awake non-stop for several months "
"now and it's getting harder and harder to keep our eyes open.\n"
"\t\t\tWe can't tell what's real from what our own tired brains fabricate anymore. "
"We live in constant fear, just one lullaby away from eternal suffering.</p>\n"
"\n"
"\t\t\t<p>Unbelievable as it may sound, Freddy Krueger is out to get us. There's "
"not enough time (or space) to explain how it's come to this but he's waiting\n"
"\t\t\tfor us to fall asleep so he can trap and torture us in our own dreams and "
"make us create themes for nightmares (whatever that means). </p>\n"
"\n"
"\t\t\t<p>So after much though we've come to the conclusion that the only way to "
"beat this is to stay awake until he dies of old age.\n"
"\t\t\tBut in order for us to stay awake that long, we'd need some sort of "
"stimulant. So, unless you have a better idea,\n"
